# UIMS
A simple and powerful university management tool that allows the administrative staff to add, update or delete the information of students and teachers. (This project is implemented while considering security and data privacy as its top priority)

Some silent features are:
<ul>
  <li>Simple UI(User-Interface)</li>
  <li>Data Privacy</li>
  <li>Source is easy to modify</li>
</ul>

I developed this project during my 2nd semester of the undergraduate course.

Developed entirely in C++ with Love. :)

Hope you like it!
